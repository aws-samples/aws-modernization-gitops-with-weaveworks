      <description>Perform this command once for each one of your clusters, by selecting the appropriate context, running the command and then switching to the other context and doing it again.
 The following command will set up your cluster with Flux v2 and configure your cluster to track its state from the repository created earlier. The first time you run this command, all manifests declaring the state of the cluster will be pushed to the repo, the second time you run it (against the second cluster), the command will refer to the state already stored in the repository.</description>
