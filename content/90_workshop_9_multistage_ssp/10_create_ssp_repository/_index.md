# Create your SSP Repository

Your Shared Services Platform repo will be the source of your desired state for all core services, as well as where you will declare the various teams you want to onboard on your platform.

This repository is usually owned and managed by Platform Operation or Infrastucture Teams. Application Development Teams will not require access rights to this repository at all, since we will use this repo to onboard each App Team's own repositories within their own namespace.
