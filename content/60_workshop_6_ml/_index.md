## Welcome to Machine Learining on AWS EKS and MLops

Data has proven to be a competitive differentiator for decades and the adoption of machine learning can now deliver even greater insights from data. Adopting machine learning requires a technology environment with processes and platforms that can deliver innovation at scale.

EKS is a managed Kubernetes platform for scale. GitOps introduces processes and principles that align with machine learning operations (MLOps) best practices: Reproducibility, Reusability, Manageability and Automation.


In this workshop we will cover:

* Manage multiple EKS clusters, environments, workloads and teams with time saving cluster models
* Install Flagger to increase deployment speed for advanced deployment patterns
* Handle canary and progressive releases safely with rollbacks

Need help in getting started with EKS? Sign up for our [EKS + GitOps Quickstart package](https://www.weave.works/eks-gitops-quickstart/). 

## GitOps - an operating model for cloud native 

GitOps can be summarized as these two things:
* An operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for containerized clusters and applications.
* A path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CICD pipelines and git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.

## Weaveworks 
Weaveworks makes it fast and simple for developers and DevOps teams to build and operate powerful containerized applications. We minimize the complexity of operating workloads in Kubernetes by providing automated continuous delivery pipelines, observability and monitoring. 
 
Weaveworks’ mission is to minimize complexities in operating workloads and provide a developer centric operating model for cloud native applications. Our goal is to drive cloud native transformation for your developers and portability, flexibility, choice and stability for your business.
 
One of the first members of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Weaveworks also contributes to several open source projects, including [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/oss/net/), [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/oss/scope/), [Weave Cortex](https://www.weave.works/oss/cortex/), [Weave Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/), [Firekube](https://www.weave.works/oss/firekube/) and [Flagger](https://www.weave.works/oss/flagger/).

## Weaveworks and AWS
Weaveworks is an [APN Advanced Technology Partner](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Weaveworks&id=001E000001ImwwVIAR) and AWS Containers Competency Partner. In addition [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/) is the EKS certified Advanced partner that built [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/).
