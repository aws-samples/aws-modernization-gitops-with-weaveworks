# Welcome to Managing governance, risk and compliance for Kubernetes on EKS

Accelerate your journey to production ready Kubernetes on EKS by learning the practical techniques for reliably operating your software lifecycle using GitOps. In this virtual workshop the Weaveworks team will be sharing their expertise as users and contributors to Kubernetes and Prometheus, as well as pioneers of GitOps (operations by pull request).

This workshops goes deep on the following topics:Using a combination of instructor led demonstrations and hands-on exercises, the workshop will enable the attendee to go into detail on the following topics:
* How to utilize IAM to configure RBAC and access control 
* How to create, assign and test IAM roles for AWS service accounts
* How to deploy open policy agent
* How to write simple and effective rego policies to achieve compliance

## GitOps - an operating model for cloud native 

* An operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for containerized clusters and applications.
* A path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CICD pipelines and git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.
