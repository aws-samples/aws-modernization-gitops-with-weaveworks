### Manage Policies and Compliance using OPA Gatekeeper


This workshop will run through how to create Constraint Templates to use with OPA Gatekeeper. We will run how to write a template, what component of a template does and also run through some  example`rego` policies.

All policies are written in rego, for detailed information on how this works please visit [here](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).

Rego is a declaritive query language that can be used to support document models such as JSON. Making it a great fit for Kubernetes!
