This manifest actually creates the ingress controller. Copy and paste the following into a file called **alb-ingress.yaml**  in each of your terminal windows. We will be creating two files, one for each cluster, as we must place the actual cluster name in this file. Replace the **XXXXXXXX** on the `cluster-name` option with the name of your cluster.

Once you have edited these two file, use `kubectl apply -f alb-ingress.yaml` **in each of your terminal sessions** to install the ingress controllers in each of your clusters. In more advanced **GitOps** usage, the different cluster names would be handled with a template, and the manifest templating tool like `helm` or using `kustomize` templates. For simplicity, we're doing this installation directly.
