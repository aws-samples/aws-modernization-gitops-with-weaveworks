# Welcome to the High Availability and Disaster Recovery Module

4 out of 10 enterprises are now running Kubernetes in a production environment today but many still consider security and policy concerns an overwhelming obstacle and bottleneck to innovation. 

GitOps operation practices give teams a head start as they rely on git’s strong correctness and security. Every pull request has a built-in and fully auditable trail. Many companies need to look beyond just compliance and seek a full GRC solution that’s integral to their workflows.

This workshops goes deep on the following topics:

* How to set up repeatable fleets of clusters with GitOps and eksctl
* How to set up multi-cluster and configure AWS services such as ELB and Route53
* How to connect ingress and DNS using GitOps

Need help in getting started with EKS? Sign up for our [EKS + GitOps Quickstart package](https://www.weave.works/eks-gitops-quickstart/).

## GitOps - an operating model for cloud native 

* An operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for containerized clusters and applications.
* A path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CICD pipelines and git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.
