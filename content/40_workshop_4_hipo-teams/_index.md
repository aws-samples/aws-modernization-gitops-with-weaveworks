# Welcome to How to Build High Performing Team Operations

Many modern enterprises embrace DevOps methodologies - automating and streamlining the integration and deployment processes - in order to increase development speed and reliability. GitOps takes DevOps principles one step further while leveraging best practices from managing application infrastructure as code.

GitOps allows development teams to use the tools that they are already familiar with - Git. Updates and features can be released more rapidly without knowing internals of Kubernetes or other operational procedures.

Operators can enable a self service model for developers while reducing overhead on lifecycle management of workloads and clusters.

In this workshop module we will learn:

* Minimize K8s steep learning curve with GitOps for EKS clusters
* Install a sample app, release and rollback versions via PR with Flux & Helm Operator
* Monitor and observe effectively with App Mesh, Prometheus and Cloudwatch

## GitOps - an operating model for cloud native

GitOps can be summarized as these two things:

* An operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for containerized clusters and applications.
* A path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CICD pipelines and git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.

## Weaveworks

Weaveworks makes it fast and simple for developers and DevOps teams to build and operate powerful containerized applications. We minimize the complexity of operating workloads in Kubernetes by providing automated continuous delivery pipelines, observability and monitoring. 

Weaveworks’ mission is to minimize complexities in operating workloads and provide a developer centric operating model for cloud native applications. Our goal is to drive cloud native transformation for your developers and portability, flexibility, choice and stability for your business.

One of the first members of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Weaveworks also contributes to several open source projects, including [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/oss/net/), [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/oss/scope/), [Weave Cortex](https://www.weave.works/oss/cortex/), [Weave Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/), [Firekube](https://www.weave.works/oss/firekube/) and [Flagger](https://www.weave.works/oss/flagger/).

## Weaveworks and AWS

Weaveworks is an [APN Advanced Technology Partner](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Weaveworks&id=001E000001ImwwVIAR) and AWS Containers Competency Partner. In addition [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/) is the EKS certified Advanced partner that built [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/).
