# Welcome to Codifying multi-cloud operations

Kubernetes is the foundation for modern cloud native architectures today but it is just one of the building blocks. To unlock cloud native agility, platform teams require new components and methodologies in order to successfully operationalize the entire stack. Many enterprise IT teams encounter production challenges when it comes to managing multi-cluster Kubernetes across multiple cloud providers.

This workshop goes deep on the following topics:

* How to use the operator pattern and tools such as the shell-operator and Custom Resource Definitions
* How to write simple controllers to manage large deployments and complex systems
* How to increase reliability and stability across the platform through GitOps best practices
* How to simplify managing multiple clusters using GitOps

## GitOps - an operating model for cloud native
GitOps can be summarized as these two things:
* An operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for containerized clusters and applications.
* A path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CICD pipelines and git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.
