<h2>Introduction to GitOps on EKS with Weaveworks</h2></div>

15 years ago, Git changed the way software teams collaborate and develop software. For new declarative software systems such as Kubernetes, Git can play a key role in deploying, configuring, updating and managing infrastructure as code. <br><br>

GitOps relies on Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With Git at the center of delivery pipelines, developers can make pull requests to accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.
 

In these workshops Weaveworks will teach and demonstrate: 

* The 4 principles of GitOps 
* How to boost stability and reliability in Kubernetes environments
* How to incorporate a robust security model from the start  
* Using GitOps for High Availability and Disaster Recovery on EKS
* Managing governance, risk and compliance (GRC) for Kubernetes on EKS  with GitOps
* Accelerating Software Development with GitOpos and EKS
* Managing Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models w/GitOps on EKS


## Who should take these workshops:

* Anyone who has interest in GitOps & EKS 
* Application teams
* Architects & Developers
* Technical leads
* Operations Engineers
* Infrastructure Teams
* Technical Business Leaders
