# Workshop 1: Introduction to GitOps on EKS

In this workshop we'll introduce you to the concepts of GitOps and how to create and operate an EKS cluster using the eksctl tool. This workshop is a prerequisite for all other workshops in this series.

If you are using your own AWS account, you will need permissions to create EKS clusters plus admin rights within your EKS cluster to configure configuration rules and install agents. Ensure you have authority within your organization to do this in your tenant.
