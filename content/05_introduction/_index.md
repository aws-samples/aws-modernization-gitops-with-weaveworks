# GitOps: Modern Operations for Kubernetes

GitOps is a standardized workflow for how to deploy, configure, monitor, update and manage Kubernetes, its components and all the applications that run on it.

GitOps relies on Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With Git at the center of delivery pipelines, developers can make pull requests to accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.

## GitOps - an operating model for cloud native 
GitOps can be summarized as these two things:

* An operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for containerized clusters and applications.
* A path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CICD pipelines and git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.

* [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works) is the EKS certified Advanced partner that built [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/). Founded in 2014, Weaveworks makes it fast and simple for developers and DevOps teams to build and operate powerful containerized applications. Weaveworks minimizes the complexity of operating workloads in Kubernetes by providing automated continuous delivery pipelines, observability and monitoring.  One of the first members of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Weaveworks also contributes to several open source projects, including Weave Scope, Weave Cortex and Weave Flux.
